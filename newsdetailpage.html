	<h2>Israel PM Netanyahu’s direct message to Iranians: ‘Iran will be free soon, Israel stands with you’</h2>
	<p>Amid heightened tensions in the Middle East, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a rare direct message to the Iranian people on Monday, stating that Israel stands with them as it fights the proxies of Tehran, like Lebanon based Hezbollah militant group.In a message relayed on YouTube and other channels, PM Netanyahu said, “Every day, you see a regime that subjugates you and makes fiery speeches about defending Lebanon, defending Gaza. Yet every day, that regime plunges our region deeper into darkness and deeper into war.”Netanyahu added that there’s no place in the Middle East where Israeli forces can’t reach and that “puppets of Iran” were being eliminated in Israel’s offensive. He further said, ”There is nowhere we will not go to protect our people and protect our country.”
	Netanyahu in his message to Iran’s people concluded by saying that they should not “let a small group of fanatic theocrats crush your hopes and your dreams. You deserve better. Your children deserve better. I know you don’t support the rapists and murderers of Hamas and Hezbollah, but your leaders do. The people of Iran should know that Israel stands with you.”</p>

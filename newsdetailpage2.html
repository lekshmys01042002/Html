	<h2>Annular solar eclipse 2024: Why ‘ring of fire’ solar eclipse won’t be visible in India</h2>
	<p>Amidst the numerous lunar eclipses, there is an annular lunar eclipse happening on October 2. However, it is only visible from some parts of the world, especially in the annular form, when the moon comes between the earth and the sun with a ring of fire surrounding it.Unfortunately, the maximum eclipse of 2024’s annular solar eclipse, that takes place on October 3 at the Indian time of 12.15 am, won’t be visible from any part of the country in any shape or form as the event happens during night time.The complete annular solar eclipse will be visible in countries like Argentina and Chile, while there will be a partial solar eclipse in countries like the United States, Mexico, New Zealand, Brazil, Falkland Islands, Uruguay, and more.There is also an interesting relationship between a lunar and a solar eclipse, as a solar eclipse occurs either before or two weeks after a lunar eclipse.</p>
